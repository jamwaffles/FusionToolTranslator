# Fusion 360 to LinuxCNC tool table converter

This is primarily a project for learning Rust, but it should also end up as a reasonably useful utility. Its purpose is to take an exported tool library from Fusion 360's tool library (which export JSON) and convert into a `.tbl` file ready to be read by LinuxCNC.
